## Guide to Available Mathematical Software in Fortran

I am trying to see if an update of https://gams.nist.gov/ using Grok to find relevant codes is worthwhile. Here are the results for two categories.

[L6a21: Uniform Random Numbers](https://github.com/Beliavsky/GAMS-Fortran/blob/main/L6a21_Uniform_Random_Numbers.md)

[L10a2: Time domain time series analysis](https://github.com/Beliavsky/GAMS-Fortran/blob/main/L10a2_Time_Domain_Time_Series_Analysis.md)
