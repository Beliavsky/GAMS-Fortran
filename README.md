## Guide to Available Mathematical Software in Fortran

I am trying to see if an update of https://gams.nist.gov/ using Grok to find relevant codes is worthwhile. I give Grok the contents of a current GAMS page, such as https://gams.nist.gov/cgi-bin/serve.cgi/Class/L6a21, and ask it to find Fortran codes on the web in general but making sure to look at GitHub, Gitlab, and the Fortran code sites of Alan Miller and John Burkardt. Fortran 77 codes are listed below codes using a more modern Fortran standard.

Here are the results for two categories.

[L6a21: Uniform Random Numbers](https://github.com/Beliavsky/GAMS-Fortran/blob/main/L6a21_Uniform_Random_Numbers.md)

[L10a2: Time domain time series analysis](https://github.com/Beliavsky/GAMS-Fortran/blob/main/L10a2_Time_Domain_Time_Series_Analysis.md)
